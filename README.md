Developed a movie recommendation system using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to suggest films based on user input preferences, optimizing paths within a genre-similarity graph, on C++.

Implemented graph-based algorithms to calculate the shortest path between films, ensuring highly relevant movie
recommendations by analyzing genre and thematic connections.

Graph based on weighted realtionship with various movies as nodes.
NOTE : The closer the movie is related to another adjacent joined movie node, the higher is the edge weight. A movie 'A' is related to movie 'B' with edge weight 6 and with another movie 'C' with edge weight 9, then it means movie 'A' is more similar to movie 'C' than movie 'B'.

The movies based graph is divided into four genres, namely : Romance, Action, Thriller, Comedy.
The movies are recommended based upon the choice of genre the user is looking for.
